(Student Information System )

DOMAIN: Voice XML

OVERVIEW:

To enhance the accessibility of the student’s information through VXML.

PRESENT SCENARIO:

Access to the required student’s profile or information is possible in the

present scenario but it includes a search engine or a web portal to acquire the

data.

DISADVANTAGES:

 Internet Connection is required always to access the information.

 Fetching of the data takes time.

PROPOSED IDEA:

Using the VXML domain to implement the Student Information System enables

its users such as the Professors/Students/Parents to directly choose the various

categories available. The request is directly transferred to the required details

with the help of SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) phone. The categories that are

made available in this idea are:

ATTENDANCE:

-Allows the user to make a call to the parents.

-Provides an opportunity to forward an SMS to the parents.

AGGREGATE:

-Current Semester percentage

-Aggregate of the student

-Backlogs Information

STUDENT’S PROFILE:

-Details of the student

FEE DUES:

-Information regarding the dues of the student.

-Scholarship details.

LIBRARY DETAILS:

-Details of the books taken and returned.

-Renewal Dates

ADVANTAGES:

 No Internet Connection is required.

 Smart phones are not required.

 Mobility

CONCLUSION:

the help of our proposed idea.
